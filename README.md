Analyzing the Zomato dataset has revealed some fascinating trends in the food industry! With a focus on data,

I uncovered that India dominates the Zomato platform with a whopping 94.39% of transactions, closely trailed by the US and the UK. This underscores Zomato's significant presence and success in the Indian market.

Interestingly, the analysis uncovered distinct customer preferences based on ratings. With a breakdown from 'Excellent' to 'Poor,' it's evident that the majority of ratings fall between 3.0 to 3.9, indicating a strong preference for quality dining experiences. Moreover, it's intriguing to note that a substantial number of customers opt not to rate their experiences, emphasizing the need for more proactive feedback mechanisms.

the data unearthed unique culinary trends, with North Indian, Chinese, and fast food emerging as the top three cuisines in demand. This suggests a continued appetite for diverse flavors and quick, convenient meal options. Notably, the prevalence of North Indian cuisine reflects the strong cultural influence and popularity of traditional flavors among customers.

Further exploration highlighted the limited online delivery options in certain Indian regions, emphasizing the need for enhanced accessibility and inclusivity.

Additionally, New Delhi emerged as the leading city in Zomato usage, followed by Gurgaon, Noida, Faridabad, and Ghaziabad, showcasing the platform's strong presence in the National Capital Region.
